Validate a [Postal Index Number][wiki] for India with a few regexes and zero false-positives. The regexes are available in `regex.txt`. There is one regex per area code (the first digit of the PIN, which goes from 1-8). Available as a package for Ruby, Python, Node.js, and browsers.

## Why?

A simple `\d{6}` approach marks a lot of invalid pincodes as valid. Out of the 900000 possible combinations, only approximately `155600` are valid pincodes in India. A simple example is `111111` which is an invalid pincode, but any simple 6 digit-check will pass it as a valid one. File a PR to support any other language.

## Source

The source for the data is the ["All India Pincode Directory"](https://data.gov.in/resources/all-india-pincode-directory) dataset on data.gov.in. The last updated date for the dataset is currently 30th May 2019.

## Usage

The `regex.txt` file is 32KB in size, so you can easily use it wherever you want, including browsers. If you are using any of the packages below, this is already delivered compressed.

### PHP

The package is available on [`packagist`](https://packagist.org/packages/captn3m0/pincode).

To use the PHP package:

```php
use PIN\Validator as P;
P::validate('110011'); // returns true;
```

### Node.js

The package is available on [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pincode-validator).

To use the package:

```js
const P = require('pincode-validator');
P.validate('110011'); // returns true
P.search('my pincode is 560029'); // returns ['560029']

// or directly use the regex in your code
P.exactRegex.match('560029')
"address with pincode (560029)".matchAll(P.regex)
````

## Ruby

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pincode_validator'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pincode_validator

### Browser

To use it in the browser, download the `pincode-regex.js` file and include it in your browser. `Pincode` is available as a Global variable.

```html
<script src="../pincode-regex.js"></script>
<script>
Pincode.validate("560029"); // returns true
</script>
```

You can use githack for directly using this in your code: <https://rawcdn.githack.com/captn3m0/india-pincode-regex/1.0.4/pincode-regex.js> (Make sure you use the latest version). Please watch the repo to get notified of new releases.
